**Data structures**, or _data types_, are used to store information in a program. Java, like all high-level languages, provides a number of built-in data types that are available for you to use right away. **Object-oriented programming**, or **OOP**, allows for simple data types to be used to create a more useful complex data structure, such as a user profile.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

#### Data Types
* **boolean** – a true or false value
* **byte** – 8-bit signed integer with possible values between -128 and 127 (inclusive)
* **short** – 16-bit signed integer with possible values between -32,768 and 32,767 (inclusive)
* **int** – 32-bit signed integer with possible values between -2<sup>31</sup> and 2<sup>31</sup>-1
* **long** – 64-bit signed integer with possible values between -2<sup>63</sup> and 2<sup>63</sup>-1
* **float** – 32-bit signed floating-point value with 6 to 9 digits of precision _(ex. '1.53')_
* **double** – 64-bit signed floating-point value with 15 to 17 digits of precision
* **char** – a single 16-bit Unicode character stored between two single-quotes _(ex. 'a')_
* String – any sequence of Unicode characters stored between two double-quotes _(ex. "a1b2c")_

> Note that Strings are not _technically_ data-types in Java. Instead, they are considered to be an **array** of characters.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
